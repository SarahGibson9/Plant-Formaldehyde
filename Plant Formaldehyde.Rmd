# Variation in Formaldehyde Removal Efficiency among Indoor Plant Species 

## Intorduction  
Formaldehyde is an indoor air pollution that is present in higher concentrations in new houses and enters the home through particle board, olywood, carpet, curtains, paper products, tobacco smoke, along with many other sources. It is known to cause “multiple chemical sensitivity” and “sick building syndrome” as well as allergies, asthma and headaches. According to WHO, indoor air volatiles are the cause of 1.6 million deaths per year. Plants can absorb and metabolize formaldehyde through their stomata and cuticle. This study assesses the half-life of different indoor plant species to determine which are most efficient in formaldehyde removal. 

## Methods  
This experiment took place between 2004 and 2008 in the Rural Development Administration. There were 86 plant species chosen that were split into 5 general categories. The plants were transplanted into 19 or 15 cm pots with a uniform growing soil. They were watered every 3 days and the amount of light was adjusted specific to each plant’s needs. A chamber of 1m3 volume (90 cm wide × 90 cm long × 123 cm high) was built with controlled temperature, light and humidity. Plants took turns being placed in the test chamber with formaldehyde gas and a Formaldehyde & Data Logging System was used to assess the amount of formaldehyde. Control chambers without plants were used to compare. 

## Results  
From the 86 plant species that were tested, 9 showed a much greater ability to remove formaldehyde. These included Osmunda japonica, Selaginella tamariscina, Davallia mariesii, Polypodium formosanum, Psidium guajava, Lavandula spp., Pteris dispar, Pteris multifida, and Pelargonium spp. Figure 1 shows the effectiveness of the 5 plant groups. The findings also expressed a relation of the more time the plants were exposed to the formaldehyde, the more they absorbed. Figure 2 shows the amount of formaldehyde that was removed over time.
